<h1>Project Description:</h1>

Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize weekly branch performance metrics for cross-selling, new, and renewal insurance opportunities, as well as to track the activity of account executives. This dashboard provides insights into achievement percentages, top-performing products, and stages by revenue, offering a data-driven overview of sales opportunities within the branch.

Data Preparation: 
Data was collected from internal sources, cleaned, and organized using Microsoft Excel to ensure consistency and accuracy.

Data Cleaning:

1. Removed duplicate entries and ensured accurate naming conventions for Account Executives and Opportunity Products.
2. Verified consistency of revenue data across different sales stages.
3. Converted relevant numeric data into percentages for easier interpretation.

Data Transformation:

1. Calculated the achievement percentage for Cross Sell, New, and Renewal categories.
2. Grouped opportunities by Account Executive for a performance-based assessment.

Data Analysis:
The data was analyzed using Microsoft Excel and Power BI to explore metrics around sales achievements, activity by Account Executives, and revenue distribution across insurance products.

Excel Analysis:

1. Created Pivot Tables to calculate the Total Revenue and Percentage Achievements across different opportunity types (Cross Sell, New, Renewal).
2. Aggregated data on the number of meetings and invoices by each Account Executive.

Power BI Dashboard:

1. Target vs. Achieved Analysis: Visualized achievement of revenue targets in Cross Sell, New, and Renewal categories.
2. Activity Tracking: Displayed the number of meetings and invoices managed by each Account Executive to assess individual performance.
3. Opportunity Stages by Revenue: Designed a funnel chart to track revenue progression through different sales stages.
4. Top Products: Identified top revenue-generating products and displayed them alongside open opportunities for prioritization.

Key Findings:

1. High Achievement Rates: Renewal placements show a high achievement percentage (195.60%), suggesting a strong focus on retaining existing clients.
2. Top Revenue Products: "Fire" and "DB - Mega Policy" are the top-performing products, contributing significantly to overall revenue.
3. Account Executive Performance: Some Account Executives (e.g., Divya Dhingra and Ankita Shah) show higher invoice volumes, indicating robust client engagement.
4. Stage Progression: Most revenue is in the "Qualify Opportunity" stage, pointing to a pipeline rich in early-stage opportunities but needing further progression.

Recommendations:

1. Enhance Sales Focus on New Business: While renewal targets are being met effectively, there is potential to improve New business achievements by aligning more resources or strategies for new client acquisition.

2. Optimize Product Offerings: Given the high revenue contribution from specific products (like "Fire" insurance), consider refining these offerings to further attract new clients or cross-sell to existing ones.

3. Performance Coaching for Account Executives: Account Executives with lower activity metrics could benefit from targeted coaching to improve their client engagement, thereby balancing workload distribution across the team.

4. Pipeline Management: Shift focus towards advancing opportunities from "Qualify Opportunity" to later stages, which could increase revenue realization.

This project highlights key performance areas within the insurance sales branch and provides actionable recommendations for optimizing both client retention and new business acquisition strategies.
